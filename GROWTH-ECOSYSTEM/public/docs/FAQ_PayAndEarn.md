# Pay&Earn — Demo FAQ (Investors & Partners)

## 1) What is Pay&Earn in one sentence?
Merchants repay financing as a % of monthly revenue, and a small fraction is reinvested into a DeFi yield pool in the merchant’s name — turning “interest” into long‑term wealth building.

## 2) Why does this matter vs. traditional funding?
Banks and classic RBF provide capital but no asset creation for the merchant. Pay&Earn turns repayments into a yield‑bearing position, potentially offsetting or even exceeding financing costs in the long run.

## 3) How do repayments work?
Example: 10% of monthly revenue goes to repayment. Inside that, ~8% reduces principal; ~2% is invested into the DeFi pool under the merchant’s wallet.

## 4) Where does the yield come from?
Audited DeFi protocols (e.g., Aave/Compound/Centrifuge) with stablecoins. We start conservative, diversify pools, and display on‑chain positions transparently in the dashboard.

## 5) What is the merchant’s net effective cost?
Illustrative: €10,000 advance → €12,000 total repayment. €2,000 is reinvested. At 10% APY over 5 years ≈ €3,200. Effective cost ~6% — potentially lower in strong markets.

## 6) What are the key risks?
Regulation, smart‑contract risk, liquidity shifts, and data quality. Mitigations: EU‑compliant stance (MiCA‑aware), audited contracts, pool diversification, anomaly detection, staged limits.

## 7) How do investors benefit?
Revenue margin on deployed capital + a share of DeFi yield + pipeline access to real merchants. Thinkdigi’s distribution, data integrations, and partner ecosystem reduce CAC and improve underwriting.

## 8) What’s the rollout plan?
Phase 1: MVP + pilot cohort (FI/SE). Phase 2: Nordic/EU launch + partner bundles (logistics, payments). Phase 3: multi‑platform and token/DAO (optional).
