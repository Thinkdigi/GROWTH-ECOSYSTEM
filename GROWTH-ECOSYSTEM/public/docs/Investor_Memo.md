# Thinkdigi Growth Ecosystem — Investor Memo (Summary)

## Why now
SME eCommerce lacks fair, fast growth capital. DeFi liquidity seeks real‑world yield. We bridge both.

## What we build
- **ThinkFi** (Financing): Invoice + revenue‑based + Pay&Earn (reinvest a fraction into DeFi yield).
- **ThinkTools** (Tech): ROI dashboard, Pay&Earn calculator, risk scoring.
- **ThinkLabs** (Services): Growth strategy, ads, automation, partner bundle.

## Customer tiers
0) Easy Start (Invoice) · 1) Launch · 2) Growth Partner (Pay&Earn) · 3) Scale & Global (Hybrid + grants)

## Edge
Trusted merchant access (Nordics/EU), data pipelines (Shopify/Ads/Klaviyo), DeFi x Commerce know‑how.

## Rounds (illustrative)
Seed €150–250k @ €1.5M pre → Series A €1.2–2.0M @ €6–8M pre → Series B €5–8M @ €25–35M pre.

## Use of funds
