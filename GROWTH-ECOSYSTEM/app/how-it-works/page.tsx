      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Pay&amp;Earn Explained</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        With Pay&amp;Earn, merchants repay financing as a percentage of their revenue. A small fraction of each
        payment is reinvested into a DeFi yield pool, accumulating value over time. This yield can offset
        financing costs, making growth capital more affordable.
