      <p className="mb-4">
        Small and mid‑sized ecommerce companies often struggle to access the capital they need to grow.
        Traditional banks and revenue‑based financing platforms focus on larger, data‑rich merchants, leaving
        promising stores underfunded.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Thinkdigi Growth Ecosystem solves this problem by combining modern financing, digital tools, and
        professional services into one offering. We provide invoice and revenue‑based capital tailored to
        businesses at every stage, with a unique Pay&amp;Earn model that lets merchants build wealth while they
        repay.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Our vision is to democratize access to growth capital for ecommerce brands everywhere, starting in the
        Nordics and scaling globally.
